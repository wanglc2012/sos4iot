Edge-Assisted Stream Scheduling Scheme for the Green-Communication-based IoT

Running Env: MATLAB R2014a

M file descriptions:

  randHamGraph.m --- generate random Hamiltonian graph according the given node scale n and edge-density d

  vdf.m --- the VDF algorithm
  
  newsimu4Fig8.m --- new simulation codes for producing Fig.8;
  
  newsimu4Fig9.m --- new simulation codes for producing Fig.9, including 10 subfigures;
  
  newsimu4Fig10.m --- new simulation codes for producing Fig.10, including 2 subfigures;
  
  Fig10Gen.m --- codes for re-producing Fig.10 based on one time simulations;
  
  newsimu_running_records.tex --- running records of producing the above mentioned Fig.8, Fig.9, and Fig.10, respectively.

Note that: Since the information of Fig.9 is totally obserable from Fig.10, the Fig.9 in the revision is removed, and thus 
Fig.10 in the revision is re-numbered as Fig.9.
